# Hybrid-Filter-Wrapper-with-Ensemble-Classifier-for-Text-Representations

Feature selection is crucial in data mining and machine learning, improving accuracy and computational efficiency. In this project we introduces a hybrid filter-wrapper approach, combining Particle Swarm Optimization and Grey Wolf Optimizer, for text data. It identifies feature subsets that enhance classifier performance and reduce dimensionality. The results indicate improved performance, favoring ensemble classifiers over single classifiers like SVM and KNN.
